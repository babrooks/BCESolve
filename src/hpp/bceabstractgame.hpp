//! The base class for games of incomplete information.
/*! This is a pure virtual base class from which to create classes
    that represent games of incomplete information. This class is used
    by the solver class, BCESolver.

    To create a game, you derive from this class and reimplement the
    BCEAbstractGame::prior and BCEAbstractGame::objective methods to return,
    respectively, the prior distribution over states and types, as
    well as the objective functions for the players and possible
    auxiliary objective functions. The user can also reimplement the
    BCEAbstractGame::dominated method to indicate if there are dominated
    actions that a given type should never play.
