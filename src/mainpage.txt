    \section introsec Introduction

    BCESolve is a library of routines for representing, solving, and
    analyzing Bayes correlated equilibria (BCE), a solution concept
    that generalized correlated equilibrium to games of incomplete
    information. BCE, like correlated equilibria, are joint
    distributions that satisfy a series of linear constraints. The
    library utilizes IBM's CPLEX linear programming package to solve
    for BCE that maximize a given linear objective, such as expected
    payoffs of the players.

    \section installsec Installation

    To use the library, you must first install CPLEX and have the
    CPLEX libraries locatable on the path. The program also uses Boost
    libraries for serialization, which the user must install. The src
    and examples directories have makefiles for building the source
    code using GNU's make. The makefile may have to be edited to
    reflect the correct path to CPLEX and Boost. The program has most
    recently been compiled with gcc 4.8.2 and run using CPLEX 12.51
    and Boost 1.57 on Centos 7. To build the program, simple open a
    terminal, change to the examples directory, and run "make".

    \section overviewsec Overview of the program

    The BCESolve library contains a series of classes for
    representing, solving, and analyzing BCE. The BCEGame class is a
    base class for representing games of incomplete information. One
    must derive from this class, and reimplement its
    BCEGame::objective and BCEGame::prior methods to reflect the
    payoff functions and the distribution of the state for the
    particular game of interest.

    The BCESolver class uses CPLEX to solve a game represented by an
    object derived from the BCEGame class, by maximizing a particular
    linear objective over all BCE for that game.

    The output from the BCESolver class is stored in a BCEData
    object. BCEData objects can be serialized and de-serialized, and
    the class also contains routines for analyzing the BCE contained
    within.

    \section examplesec Examples
    
    A number of examples have been provided to illustrate how to use
    the program. Please see fpaknown.cpp, which uses the class files
    fpaknown.hpp and fpagame.hpp, for an example that solves a private
    first price auction. The file fpaunknown.cpp uses fpagame.hpp to
    solve an "unknown" private value auction. Both of these programs
    show how to derive from the BCEGame class to create a
    representation of your own game.

    \section finalsec Final thoughts

    The library also contains two utilities for studying games in
    MATLAB. The first is a mex file interface called "bcemex" that can
    be used to read BCEData objects, and translate various data from
    the BCEData class into the MATLAB workspace. Second, the MATLAB
    program bcegui.m is a graphical user interface that, together with
    bcemex, provides various visualizations of a BCE.

    Enjoy!
